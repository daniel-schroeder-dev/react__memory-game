# Memory Game

Click the cards to reveal their color. Each card has a match somewhere on the board, see if you can find them all!

## Rules

1. Click a card to reveal the color of the card.
2. Click another card, if the colors are the same, the colors will stay revealed. If the colors are different, both cards will return to a grey color.
3. The game is finished when all of the cards have been successfully revealed.

## TODO

- Setup some sort of scoring mechanism:
  - Maybe only allow so many wrong 'matches' before game is up
- Levels? Could have more squares for each successive level, these could be unlocked by completed lower levels or you could just select a level at the start of the game
- Could have a level where the cards that aren't matched change colors after so many missed matches.
- Setup some sort of way to track progress for a player, maybe save state so they can come back to the game.
- Have a speed level, where you have to complete the game in a certain amount of time.
- Have a level where the colors are really close to each other, so it's harder to determine a match.
- Document the code!!!
