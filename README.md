# Memory Game

## TODO

- Show 'Winner!' banner when game is complete
- 'New Game' button needs to be hooked up
- Setup some sort of scoring mechanism:
  - Maybe only allow so many wrong 'matches' before game is up
- Levels? Could have more squares for each successive level, these could be unlocked by completed lower levels or you could just select a level at the start of the game
- Could have a level where the cards that aren't matched change colors after so many missed matches.
- Setup some sort of way to track progress for a player, maybe save state so they can come back to the game.
